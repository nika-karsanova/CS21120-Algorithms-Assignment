/**
 * The interface for a job which must be scheduled by the Simulator.
 * A job has a priority, a duration, a unique ID and a time submitted.
 * When a job is added to the simulator it is "waiting" and does not
 * get ticked (updated) when the simulator runs. Once a resource is free
 * is can be added to the simulator's running jobs. The simulator will
 * tick running jobs, and once the job has been ticked "duration" times,
 * the job is "done" and the resource (the ambulance) can be freed for 
 * other jobs.
